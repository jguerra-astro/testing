# Opportunities in the Geha Group

- <b>Graduate Students:</b>  First year graduate students in the Yale Astronomy program are required to do two short research projects before starting their PhD thesis research.  Please contact to discuss first or second year observing projects.
- <b>Yale Undergraduates:</b>  Yale undergraduate students often do original research. Yale provides many opportunities for research funding, including the <a href="https://science.yalecollege.yale.edu/stem-fellowships/funding-stem-opportunities-yale/stars">STARS</a> program and summer funding available through each residential college.  
- <b>Undergraduates Beyond Yale:</b>  The <a href="https://astronomy.yale.edu/undergraduate-program/research/dorrit-hoffleit-undergraduate-research-scholarship">Dorrit Hoffleit</a> fellowship provides undergraduate science majors in Astronomy, Astrophysics, or Physics, in their 2nd or 3rd year of undergraduate study the opportunity to spend the summer working as a researcher in Astronomy at Yale. 
- <b>Postdoctoral Scholars:</b>  Yale provides excellent support for externally-funded fellowships (e.g., Hubble or NSF AAP Fellows), and the Geha group is happy to host such fellows. The YCAA Prize Fellowship provides funding for fellows at Yale, and such fellows are welcome to join the Geha group. Additionally, postdocs are hired directly by the group as funding allows.
