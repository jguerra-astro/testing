    Erin is a YCAA Prize Postdoctoral Fellow at the Yale Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics. She received her PhD in Astrophysical Sciences from Princeton University in 2022. Erin's research focuses on extragalactic surveys of low-mass galaxies, where she studies the ways in which dwarf galaxies inform our understanding of physics at both larger and smaller scales. Her work is particularly centered on the relationship between the star formation cycle and the low-mass galaxy population.
